    The top level entry is the poll itself. It should be used to render the
    "header" for the poll. Include any required HTML to do so. Note that each
    poll should have a unique URL, but the URL does not have to be "real". It
    can be a virtual path that includes an ID or other element.

    The remaining entries are the poll options. There are two examples here but
    there can be as many as desired. Note that these options are children of the
    parent defined above.

    "Votes" are measured as "Replies" against the poll options. You can collect
    them in one or both of these ways:

      1. Via a direct submit through the API, with a "target" of the poll option
         URI. Typically this would be done through the Echo Submit Proxy.
      2. Via a DataServer feed, such as from a Twitter hashtag search. Set the
         target URL for the search to be the poll option URL.

    The "content" of the poll option may use the following template placeholders
    to render the options:

      {poll:count}      - The number of votes submitted for the option
      {poll:percent}    - The percentage of votes submitted for the option

    HTML elements may also be included that have special behaviors. These are
    driven by classes applied to the elements:

      selection        - "Shown" until the user has voted. May be used to show
                         a pre-vote state. "Hidden" after the user has voted.
      result           - "Shown" after a user has voted to display the result.

    The examples below use both of these features to drive their behavior.
